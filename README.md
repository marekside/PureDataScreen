## About PureDataScreen

A clean data field for Wahoo nostalgic ;)
It is a 1 Field data screen with two pre-configured layouts (1+4 and 1+6).

How to use:

- using Garmin Connect select your Edge Device - Activity Profiles - Select the profile you want to change
- Select Data Screens - Add Data Screen - Data Screen - 1 Field
- Now on your edge device select the activity profile of choice (the one where you have added the new field)
- Navigate to the newly added field
- Edit it by pressing and holding the menu button. Press again the menu to edit.
- Select the Category "Connect IQ"
- Select "PureDataScreen"

From Connect IQ you can switch between the predefined layouts 1+4 or 1+6.
